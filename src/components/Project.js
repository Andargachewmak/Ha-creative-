        summary: `ScrawlrBox are the leading monthly subscription box for premium art supplies...
The pressure was on when creating a logotype for a long-established company used by countless designers and artists every month - their previous logo was very recognisable, but was in need of modernisation, which is where we came in!
It was a pleasure working with Chris to develop their logotype into something that matched the premium nature of their products as well as create a bespoke company font to be adaptable for their other projects; ScrawlrZine, ScrawlrBlanks and their Blackwing x ScrawlrBox collection, to name a few.
Weâ€™re incredibly pleased with the finished logo and bespoke font, and when our boxes arrive it always puts a smile on our faces!`,
